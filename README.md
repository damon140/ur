# ur

This is a simple implementation of the Royal Game of Ur, which is an ancient game that was
played about 5,000 years ago in the Sumerian/ Arkadian empire. 

I made it to explore the game, use Java 17 and write a tiny game from scratch
which I haven't done in 30 years, probably.

See this
[web site](https://royalur.net/)
and
[git repository](https://github.com/Sothatsit/RoyalUrClient)
for a fancy implementation.
