This is a simple implementation of the Royal Game of Ur, which is an ancient game that was
played about 5,000 years ago in the Sumerian/ Arkadian empire,
[see this cool history on youtube.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2lJUOv0hLA)

I made it to explore the game, use Java 17, KotlinJS and to code a tiny game from scratch
which I haven't done in 30 years since 8 bit days.

See this
[web site](https://royalur.net/)
and
[git repository](https://github.com/Sothatsit/RoyalUrClient)
for fancier work than here.

Also worth mentioning this [similar project in React](https://bizley.github.io/royal-game-of-ur/).
There are some others, but need to build locally it appears.
